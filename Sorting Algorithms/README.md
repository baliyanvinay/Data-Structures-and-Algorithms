## 1. Bubble Sort
- Compare elements next to each other, swap if required.
- Requires two loops, inner loop to compare elements & swap, outer loop to repeat the process until no swap.
## 2. Selection Sort
- Minimum element from the list is selected & swapped at the begining of unsorted list. 
- Requires two loops, one for traversing & another to compare & find minimum element. 
## 3. Insertion Sort
- An item is traversed & compares all items to its left to find its spot. 
- Requires two loops, one for traversing & inner while loop to compare item with items to its left. 
## 4. Merge Sort
## 5. Quick Sort
## 6. Heap Sort
## 7. Counting Sort
## 8. Radix Sort
## 9. Bucket Sort
