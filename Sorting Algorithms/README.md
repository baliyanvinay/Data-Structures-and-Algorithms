| Bucket Sort |
## 1. Bubble Sort
- Compare elements next to each other, swap if required.
- Requires two loops, inner loop to compare elements & swap, outer loop to repeat the process until no swap.
## 2. Selection Sort
- Minimum element from the list is selected & swapped at the begining of unsorted list. 
- Requires two loops, one for traversing & another to compare & find minimum element. 
## 3. Insertion Sort
- An item is traversed & compares all items to its left to find its spot. 
- Requires two loops, one for traversing & inner while loop to compare item with items to its left. 
## 4. Merge Sort
- Divide and conquer is used until each sub array has one element left. 
- Copies are made of sub-arrays & data is compared between left & right sub-arrays.
- Based on the above comparision, values are replaced in the existing array.
- Requires additional space for array copies & recursion is used.
